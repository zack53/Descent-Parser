# Descent-Parser
The descent parser reads in a .txt file to build a GUI. The specific grammer of the parser is described in the Project-Details.pdf file. Once you have downloaded the source files and the program starts, the first thing that shows is a file selector. First, you should select the .txt file you wish to run with the program, and after you have selected the file, the program will automatically parse the file to create a GUI.
